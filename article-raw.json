To give a concrete example, we have routinely encountered metadata about scholarly articles featuring one { “givenName”: “Et”, “familyName”: “Al” } as one of the authors (and a most prolific one at that). Since the CSS styling is targeting the semantic information containing the document, such occurrences look wrong (rendered as people) even on casual inspection."

Incrementing the patch component signals a small, backwards-compatible bug fix; incrementing the minor component indicates additive changes that do not break compatibility; and incrementing the major is reserved for cases that will most likely break dependents. The exact manner in which these are issued is not enforced; rather it is expected that publishers will use their discretion to apply semantic versioning in a manner that works well for their consumers and will wish to avoid the reputational cost involved in signalling greater reliability than is effectively the case.
